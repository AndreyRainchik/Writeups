# Writeups

This repository contains writeups for various vulnerable virtual machines that I've managed to get into. The virtual machines come from [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/ "VulnHub's main page") so that all of my penetration testing is limited to systems that I own and remains fully legal.
